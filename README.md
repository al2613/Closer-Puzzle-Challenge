# JavaScript Closure-Puzzle-Challenge

Goal: This challenge is meant to help solidify the concept of closures in Javascript by understanding how  
the closure contains all the variables that are in scope at the time. When a function is called, it brings with it its sorrounding memory. 

It is analogous to a backpack. In this backpack, the function stores all the variables that are in scope at the time that the function definition was created.

Task:
1. Calculate the final value of the result variable 
2. Alert the value as a number using one line of code

Running the Tests:
1. You can copy and paste the starter code into JavaScript section of https://jsfiddle.net/
